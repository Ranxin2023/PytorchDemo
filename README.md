# Pytorch Demo
## Concepts
### 1.PyTorch
- PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that provides:
    - **Tensors** (like NumPy arrays but with GPU acceleration)

    - **Autograd** (automatic differentiation for gradients)

    - **Modules** and layers to build neural networks

    - **Optimizers** to train models
    Itâ€™s widely used for research and production.

### 2. Tensor
-  A multi-dimensional array (like a matrix).
- In PyTorch:
```python
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```
- Tensors can be processed on CPU or GPU.
- They are the basic data structure for inputs, outputs, weights.

### 3. Neural Network (Fully Connected / Dense)
- A sequence of layers where:

    - Every neuron connects to every neuron in the next layer.

    - Example from `neural_network2.py`:
    ```python
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28*28, 128)  # input: 784 pixels, output: 128 neurons
    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)     # output: 10 classes
    ```
### 4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- A neural network designed for image data.
- In `CNNDemo.py`:

```python
self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, 3, padding=1)
self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)
```
- CNNs use:

    - **Convolution layers** to extract features (edges, shapes)

    - **Pooling layers** to reduce size + computation

    - **Fully connected layers** at the end for classification.
